        "\n",
        "In healthcare, data is often spread across different systems and formats, making it tough to get a clear, unified view of patient information. Without pulling together demographics, health conditions, and medication trends in one place, it’s hard to identify which groups are at higher risk, allocate resources efficiently, or set up preventive care where it’s needed. Real-time data is also limited, which means delayed responses for conditions that might need immediate action.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project focuses on building a data pipeline to bring together structured and semi-structured patient data from various sources, including real-time streams. By integrating this data into both relational and NoSQL databases, the pipeline will enable detailed reporting on patient demographics, conditions, and medication trends. The goal is to give healthcare providers easy access to insights that support smarter, data-driven decisions for better patient care and proactive health management."
